    <h1>Project Team 3: Worldwide Trasportation Data, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Max Goldmuntz</strong>, <strong>Joshua Uhl</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by  <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman at </a> <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>We wanted to look at worldwide transportation data, and compare government spending with public transit quality.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>We hope that our visualization will show the relationship between the GDP of a country and its transit quality.</em></p>

    <p><em>Our visualization links a table that holds all realted data about all countries to a bubble chart showing GDP and trasportation efficiency and rating.<p><em>
    
      <h1>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</h1>



    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>We compiled our data into one master set, then plotted it. Our data sources did match the problem statement as we got them from reputable sources. We used the data, which breaks down transit spending by country a well as the results of the spending, and made a table and chart showing the data. </em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>We identified four main tasks: gathering and preparing the data, displaying it in a table,  visualizing it in a bubble chart, and finally linking the two. Finally, we added the task of formatting, attempting to make the webpage and data presentation look good. Formatting the table was really hard, and even working with a TA for a while we couldn't get the table to show up the way we wanted it too..</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <div class="design-process-images">
      <img src="images/Josh-Vis.png" alt="Mockup Design 1" width="45%">
      <img src="images/Max-Vis.png" alt="Mockup Design 2" width="45%">
      <img src="images/Excel-vis.png" alt="Excel Rough Draft" width="45%">
    </div>

  <p>The first two images are of our original mockup designs. The third image is of our rough draft in Excel. Originally, we were going to do a world map, but we thought using a bubble chart would be better to show the data in more detail and it would be easier to synthesize. The model we made in Excel was very usable, and we hoped that our final project would have the same functionality.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Overall, our group decided what kind of infomation we wanted to display, found the data, sketched our ideal visualizations, mocked them in excel, and than codded them for our final project. Given more time, I think we would hve liked to acomplish more functionality with the data, and cleaned up the formatting more.</em></p>
