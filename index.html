    <h1>Project Team 3: Worldwide Trasportation Data, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Max Goldmuntz</strong>, <strong>Joshua Uhl</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by  <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman at </a> <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>We wanted to look at worldwide transportation data, and compare government spending with public transit quality.</em></p>
    
    <p><em> We wanted to explore whether an increase in GDP per capita results in an increae in public transportation quality. The transit quality is measured as a number 1-7, and was recieved from an online data source. </em></p>

    <p><em>Our visualization links a table that holds country data on GDP per capita and public transit efficiency<p><em>
  
    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>We compiled our data into one master set, and ran a python script to format it and make it look nice on the website. Our data sources did match the problem statement as we got them from reputable sources. We used the data, which breaks down GDP per capita a well as transit quality, and made a table and bubble chart showing the data. </em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>We identified four main tasks: gathering and preparing the data, displaying it in a table,  visualizing it in a bubble chart, and finally linking the two. Finally, we added the task of formatting, attempting to make the webpage and data presentation look good. Formatting the table was really hard, and even working with a TA for a while couldn't get it to work. It took a serious amount of time to compile the data neatly and have it show up on the webpage properly. Linking the data to the actual table and chart was the most difficult time, as the data was constantly formatted incorrectly, but after a lot of effort we finally got it to work.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <div class="image-column">
      <img src="images/Josh-Vis.png" alt="Mockup Design 1" class="image">
      <p class="caption"><em>This is the original mockup design from Josh.</em></p>
      <img src="images/Max-Vis.png" alt="Mockup Design 2" style="transform: rotate(90deg); transform-origin: center; height: 100px; width: auto;">
       <p class="caption"><em>This is the original mockup design from Max.</em></p>
      <img src="images/Excel-vis.png" alt="Excel Rough Draft" class="image">
      <p class="caption"><em>This is the original mockup design from our Excel model. It included the filter option, and worked very well.</em></p>
    </div>

  <p>The first two images are of our original mockup designs. The third image is of our rough draft in Excel. Originally, we were going to do a world map, but we thought using a bubble chart would be better to show the data in more detail and it would be easier to synthesize. The model we made in Excel was very usable, and we hoped that our final project would have the same functionality. Untimately, this hope came true as our final project looks even better than we expected.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Overall, our group decided what kind of infomation we wanted to display, found the data, sketched our ideal visualizations, mocked them in excel, and than codded them for our final project. Given more time, I think we would hve liked to accomplish more functionality with the data, possibly adding a world map as well. But we are very happy with the effort we put into the project and the result we got out.</em></p>
